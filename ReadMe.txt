1. Due to time restriction NO test projects have been invluded in the solution.

	As a testing 'shortcut' 4 data files have been added to a TestData folder in the startup project.

	Note that they are ALWAYS copied to the output directory so that they can be selected from the file selection dialog.

	They are located in the following local subdirectory after the solution has been taken from git:

	 \damian-boukliev-employees\EmployeesPairRanking\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\TestData

2.  As no type was specified for the UI project, I've implemented it as Windows Forms application because this is the least time cosuming option.
